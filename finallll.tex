\end{center}
\begin{center}    
    \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
Blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries by providing a decentralized and transparent system for managing transactions. Nakamoto's seminal paper on Bitcoin in 2008 introduced the concept of a blockchain, a distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This innovation laid the foundation for numerous applications beyond cryptocurrencies, such as smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Smart contracts have been extensively explored in academic research and industry applications, showcasing their potential to automate processes, enhance security, and reduce the need for intermediaries. \\
In the realm of salary disbursement, traditional methods involve manual processing, significant paperwork, and intermediaries such as banks, which can lead to delays, errors, and increased costs. Recent studies highlight the inefficiencies and lack of transparency in these conventional systems. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution by enabling automated, secure, and transparent salary payments through smart contracts. Research indicates that implementing blockchain in salary disbursement can mitigate fraud, reduce transaction times, and ensure accurate and timely payments. Additionally, using blockchain enhances data security and integrity, as each transaction is cryptographically secured and immutable. This literature survey underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology in creating more efficient and trustworthy systems for salary disbursement.

\subsection*{2.1 Problem Statement}
\begin{center}    
    \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
 In traditional payroll systems, inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and security risks pose significant challenges for both employers and employees. These conventional methods often involve manual processes, are prone to errors, and can result in delayed payments, ultimately leading to mistrust and dissatisfaction among employees.
Traditional payroll systems face several challenges, including a lack of transparency that hinders real-time visibility into the disbursement process, potentially leading to discrepancies and mistrust. These systems are also susceptible to security risks, such as data breaches, fraud, and unauthorized access, which can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of financial transactions. Inefficiencies within these systems often result in delayed payments, negatively impacting employee morale and financial stability. Additionally, the manual handling of salary disbursements is both time-consuming and error-prone, increasing administrative overhead and the likelihood of mistakes.

\begin{center}
 \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
This chapter describes the datasets used for training and evaluating the emotion detection model in this project. The data is sourced from the Face Expression Recognition Dataset available on Kaggle
\end{center}
\vspace{0.7em}
\subsection*{5.1.1 Face Expression Recognition Dataset : Train}
\begin{center}
 \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
The training dataset is a subset of the Face Expression Recognition Dataset, specifically curated for model training. Key characteristics include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} Used to train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion recognition.
    \item \textbf{Size:} Approximately 28,709 images.
    \item \textbf{Image Format:} 48x48 pixel grayscale facial images.
    \item \textbf{Emotion Classes:} 7 categories - Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.
    \item \textbf{Balance:} Roughly equal distribution across emotion categories to prevent bias.
\end{itemize}
This substantial training set allows for effective learning of facial features associated with different emotions.
\end{center}
\vspace{0.7em}
\subsection*{5.1.2 Face Expression Recognition Dataset : Test}
\begin{center}
 \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
The testing dataset is the remaining portion of the Face Expression Recognition Dataset, reserved for model evaluation. Its characteristics are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} Used to evaluate the trained model's performance on unseen data.
    \item \textbf{Size:} Approximately 7,178 images.
    \item \textbf{Image Format:} Identical to the training set - 48x48 pixel grayscale facial images.
    \item \textbf{Emotion Classes:} Same 7 categories as the training set.
    \item \textbf{Independence:} Completely separate from the training set to ensure unbiased evaluation.
\end{itemize}
This testing set provides a means to assess the model's generalization capabilities and real-world performance.\\
Both datasets are derived from the same source, ensuring consistency in image quality and labeling methodology. The 80-20 split between training and testing is a common practice in machine learning, providing a good balance between model learning and evaluation.

\section*{5.2 Methodology Used}
\begin{center}
 \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
This project employs a combination of computer vision and deep learning techniques to achieve real-time emotion detection. The methodology can be broken down into three main components:
\end{center}
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsection*{5.2.1 Face Detection}
\begin{center}
 \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
We utilize the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection due to its efficiency and real-time performance capabilities. This algorithm uses a series of simple features, known as Haar-like features, which are calculated based on the intensity differences between adjacent rectangular regions within an image. By leveraging these features, the classifier can quickly identify facial structures. The cascade of classifiers works hierarchically, rapidly discarding non-facial regions and retaining potential face candidates for further analysis. This approach ensures fast and accurate face detection, even in video frames, and performs well under various lighting conditions and orientations, making it highly reliable and versatile.
\end{center}
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsection*{5.2.2 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Emotion Classification}
\begin{center}
 \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
Our emotion detection system relies on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with the Face Expression Recognition dataset. The architecture is adapted from VGGNet , with several convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by max pooling layers to reduce dimensionality. The network ends with fully connected layers that process the features, and the output layer uses a softmax activation function to classify emotions into seven categories. This design enables accurate and efficient recognition of various emotional expressions.
\end{center}
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsection*{5.2.3 Real-time Processing and User Interface}
\begin{center}
 \setstretch{1.5} % Adjust line spacing
    \justify
We use OpenCV for real-time video processing and Streamlit for the user interface. OpenCV handles the continuous processing of each webcam frame, detecting faces and classifying emotions swiftly. The results are then displayed through Streamlit, which provides a clear and interactive interface to present the detected emotions in real-time. This setup ensures seamless and immediate feedback on emotional states from the video feed.
